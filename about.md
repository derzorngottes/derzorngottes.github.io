hey there! I'm a software engineer specializing and working in AR/VR. In my spare time I play around with pixel art and game dev.

  
I'm super passionate about helping people from marginalized communities get into tech and making the industry a more
equitable place. This is my space to collect thoughts, advice, and ideas to further these goals.
